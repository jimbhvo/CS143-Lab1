CS 143 Lab 2 Writeup

My name: Nathan Fischer, #804180060

For this lab, we will be using 1 slip day. Because we used 2 slip days for
lab 1, and 1 slip day for lab 2, this is our final slip day.

Design decisions
----------------

For selectivity estimation, we followed the guidelines in the spec. 30% was the default value used.

Joins were also ordered as recommended in the spec.

We did not implement any bonus exercises.

Changes to the API
------------------

We did not make any notable changes to the API that were not already made
during lab 1. We only filled out skeleton functions.

Missing or incomplete code
--------------------------

We have no incomplete or missing code to the best of our knowledge.

We were able to pass all tests and systemtests for this lab. The query evaluation passes as well.

Time spent on the project
-------------------------

No aspects of the lab were unreasonably challenging. The biggest challenge was locating a bug in SeqScan where table aliases were not prepended to column names
